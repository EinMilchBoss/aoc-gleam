# What

Advent of code for Gleam.

# Run code

```bash
gleam run -m year_<year>/day_<day>/main
```

\<year>: The AoC year.

\<day>: The AoC day with a length of 2 left-padded with "0".

# Run tests

The folder structure is mirrored, so the command is exactly the same as for running the code itself.

Just use `gleam test` in the beginning instead.
